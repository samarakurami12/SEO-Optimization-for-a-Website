# SEO-Optimization-for-a-Website



Project overview
This project performs an in-depth SEO audit of an existing website, identifies improvement areas, and implements optimizations to improve search visibility and user experience. It includes on-page, off-page, and technical SEO checks and tracks improvement over time.

Goals
- Identify on-page, off-page, and technical SEO issues.
- Produce prioritized recommendations and an implementation plan.
- Measure baseline metrics and track improvements (rankings, organic traffic, bounce rate).
- Improve page load speed and mobile UX.

High-level steps
1. Setup analytics and tracking (Google Analytics / GA4, Google Search Console).
2. Crawl the site (Screaming Frog / Sitebulb / similar).
3. Run performance & accessibility audits (Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights).
4. Audit on-page SEO (meta tags, title tags, headings, alt text, keyword usage).
5. Audit technical SEO (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, canonical tags, hreflang if relevant).
6. Audit off-page SEO (backlink profile, referring domains, spam links).
7. Suggest prioritized fixes and estimate effort/impact.
8. Implement changes and monitor results over time.
